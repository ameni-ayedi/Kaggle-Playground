## ðŸ§  Overview

The goal of this project is to **predict the beats-per-minute (BPM)** of songs using various audio and metadata features.  
This task comes from a **machine learning competition** where participants build regression models to estimate the tempo of a track based on the provided dataset.

Accurate BPM prediction can help in **music recommendation**, **genre classification**, and **playlist generation** by understanding a songâ€™s rhythmic characteristics.
